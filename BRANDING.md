**r/SideProject:**
```
Title: I built a Pomodoro timer that calculates your earnings while
you work (freelancers rejoice!)

Hey everyone! I just launched PomPay - a Pomodoro timer specifically
built for freelancers and consultants who bill by the hour.

**The Problem I Solved:**
I was using Toggl for time tracking, Pomofocus for staying focused,
and Excel for calculating earnings. It was three separate tools and
lots of manual work.

**What It Does:**
- Pomodoro timer with 25/5/15 intervals
- Set hourly rates per project
- Automatically calculates earnings as you work
- Financial tracking (income/expenses per project)
- Works offline, syncs to cloud

**Tech Stack:**
React, Supabase, Web Workers for background timer

**Unique Features:**
- Background timer keeps running even when tab is minimized
- Floating timer widget that follows you across pages
- Sequential project numbering (#1, #2, #3)
- Lo-fi music integration

It's 100% free and works completely offline if you don't want cloud sync.

Would love feedback from other freelancers!

**r/freelance:**
```
Title: Free tool I built to track billable hours + calculate earnings
automatically

Fellow freelancers - do you track your time manually then calculate
earnings in a spreadsheet? I built PomPay to solve this.

**How it works:**
1. Create projects with your hourly rate ($50/hr, $100/hr, etc)
2. Start a Pomodoro timer for that project
3. Your earnings auto-calculate as you work

**Why Pomodoro?**
The 25-minute focus blocks help me stay on task and avoid burnout.
Plus the forced breaks mean I actually take them.

**Other features:**
- Financial tracking per project (income - expenses = profit)
- Export to CSV for invoicing (coming soon)
- Calendar view to see your productive days
- Works offline

Built this for myself but figured other freelancers might find it
useful. It's free and open source.

Feedback welcome!
